/**
 * NOTES:
 *
 * Base color set includes mostly muted blue-grays for a semi-monocrhomatic
 * scheme with pops of color for important things. The idea being instead of
 * having lots of bright colors, the theme is low intensity and has judicious
 * use of bright colors.
 * Some important colors used indirectly are:
 * - #6bc2c8(for support shade)
 * - #d0f86f(saved for storage)
